## CSI-418Y Fall 2020 Term Project
### 4UM
#### Modern internet forum software
4UM is forum-style communication built within a full MERN stack. This was developed according to the specifications laid out by another software team in the fall 2020 CSI-418Y class at the University of Albany. This is an extremely bare-bones implementation, as much of the design vision was not possible to implement as part of a class project in a single semester. 4UM currently includes the features necessary to facilitate communication between users, and to serve this software on the internet. 
 
### Features
Everything needed to deploy a 4UM site is included here. Developed in the MERN (Mongo, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. Users can register accounts and set up a basic profile with profile image, and participate in conversations. Users do not need to be registered in order to view public content. 
 
At present a 4UM site is one single board which contains a number of topics. Topics contain a number of threads. Threads contain a number of posts, which are the comunications submitted by users.
